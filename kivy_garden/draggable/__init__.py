Draggable
=========

Inspired by:

* `drag_n_drop (Kivy Garden)`_
* Flutter_

This adds a drag and drop functionality to layouts and widgets. There are 3
components used to have drag and drop:

* The :class:`KXDraggableBehavior`. An equivalent of drag_n_drop's
  ``DraggableObjectBehavior``.
* The :class:`KXReorderableBehavior`. An equivalent of drag_n_drop's
  ``DraggableLayoutBehavior``.
* The :class:`KXDroppableBehavior`. An equivalent of Flutter's
  ``DragTarget``.

Main differences from drag_n_drop
---------------------------------

* Drag is triggered by long-press. More precisely, when a finger of the user
  touched inside a draggable widget, if the finger stays for ``drag_timeout``
  milli seconds without traveling more than ``drag_distance`` pixels, it will
  be recognized as a dragging gesture.
* :class:`KXReorderableBehavior` can handle multiple drags simultaneously.
* Drag can be cancelled by calling ``KXDraggableBehavior.drag_cancel()``.
* Nested ``KXReorderableBehavior`` is not officially supported. It may or may
  not work depending on how ``drag_classes`` and ``drag_cls`` are set.
